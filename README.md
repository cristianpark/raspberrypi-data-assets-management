# Data Assets Management on Raspberry Pi
As we all do in this convoluted yet exciting world we live in, I own at least 10 devices where I have seggragated data without any clear data approach -something I'd like to tackle either here or separatedly in my blog posts htts://cristianpark.wordpress.com- and my data world is becoming messy and the changes in 3D world don't help much so I think it's time for me to take action on that while playing around with my raspbery and elaborate a software product from scratch on my own (or with people that'd like to jump in and get hands on).

The initial idea behind this project is to come up with a web-based solution self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5 in my local network that allows me to keep my data assets on track,
having a proper inventory of them in a general sense, learning a thing or two in the process.

## Possible Implementations:
üöÄ 1. Rclone + SQLite (DIY Solution)
üß≠ 2. Recoll (Search & Indexing)
üìÇ 3. Tracker (File Indexer)
üõ†Ô∏è 4. Pika Backup + Manual Index
‚úèÔ∏è 5. DIY Script (Simple & Customizable)

Ideas/Tasks:
* Choose a name for the project.
* The main pain point I want to address by this initiative is to better organize my data assets, as well as keep a clear picture of the backup strategy of the important datasets, keep the goal in mind!.
* Design a DB to support the Website/App.
* Create a simple DB initially stored in SQLLite to keep the inventory of the data assets, providing the expect functionality in the app.
* Have web-based functionality + Android App, basic authentication.
* Have a script for files scan retrieving OS metadata for them and creating the first view / updating existing records as needed (to be executed periodically in the source devices).
* Mockup a simple personal devices/storages architecture to understand the starting point.
* Mockup a simple design of the solution to display the picture I have in mind for the final product.
* Create a simple web app and host it in the raspberry Pi.
* Integrate a backup strategy (out of the scope of the project but highly related to the need to solve).
* Scale the DB as needed and think about migration when the time comes but start lighweight first.

Expected functionalities:
* Present a simple UI to manage Digital Assets, name to come!
* Retrieve all data assets (folders/files of any type) in a given device/storage unit/network drive) inventory using a Python script which syncronizes to the main DB stored in the Raspberry Pi.
* Leverage AI tools to get insights about the data assets (for the sake of having fun).
* Track storage devices lifespan to predict possible point of failure for each to prevent
